::: {.column-page}

I am an ecologist driven to unravel the complexities of community dynamics and the cascading trophic effects that shape our natural world. 
My career has led me through a variety of roles, from leading a natural history study of Galapagos Diptera across five islands, assessing potential bat habitat in the man-made abandoned mineshafts of New Mexico, to conducting transects across the Nevada desert to track the population dynamics of Mojave Desert tortoises.

Along the way, I have honed my skills in the field working with cutting edge technologies including mutli-spectral drones, advanced GNSS systems, LiDAR, camera traps, and remote sensing. 
In the classroom, through TAships I have focused on teaching quantitive skills including Python, R, occupancy models, and bayesian statistics. 

Currently, as a third-year PhD candidate at the University of Southern California, I am leading a team to research the effects of rewilding Santa Fe Island in the Galapagos through the introduction of Espa√±ola Giant Tortoises (*Chelonoidis hoodensis*).

**Interests:** Biogeography, Trophic Ecology, Ecological Restoration, Science Communication, Quantative Ecology 


## Inquiries
I am always looking to collaborate and share ideas, feel free to reach out to me [via email](mailto:lehnen@usc.edu).

## Mentorship
Science education and work is an essential aspect of my work. If I am not helping to empower the next generation of scientists, I feel that my job as a scientist is not complete. If you are seeking mentorship, help, or just advice, please contact me [via email](mailto:Lehnen@usc.edu).
