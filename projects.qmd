* Natural History of Galapagos Diptera
I led a 4-year natural history study across 5 of the Galapagos islands. This project was a key aspect to the goals of the international Philornis Working Group which focuses on the devastatingly invasive fly *Philornis downsi*. Understanding the ecology of Galapagos Diptera was essential in estimating impacts of *P. downsi* control prospects and acquiring endemic, dipteran pupae for non-target biocontrol testing. Prior to my study, the community ecology and rearing substrates of Galapagos Diptera had been virtually unknown. Presently, I am preparing the associated publication as first author.

* Assesing Abandoned Mines as a Protected Resource
We evaluated the biological relevance of abandoned New Mexican mines as bat roosting, flyover sites, and/or hibernacula. This also included nose swabs for *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* and guano collection for molecular analysis. Sites were reached through technical 4x4 off-roading, backcountry hiking, and advanced vertical ropework. We used technology including LiDAR, satellite imagery, ArcGIS, GPS, and orienteering to collect precise geospatial data. As an auxiliary aspect, we conducted pre-development avian surveys at mine closure sites utilizing bird identification and nest surveying skills.

* USFWS Population Monitoring of Mojave Desert Tortoises
Along line-distance sampling transects, I collected georeferenced biometric data on IUCN vulnerable Mojave desert tortoise (*Gopherus agassizii*) populations across Nevada following strict sterile field technique. Metrics included body condition scores, nasal/discharge scores to screen for Mycoplasma infection, and morphological measurements. All protocols were specifically designed to avoid complications including hypothermia, loss of fluids, and transmission of disease/parasites between tortoises.

* Charles Darwin Foundation GeoPortal Development
I helped develop a novel GeoPortal which distributes Galapagos geographical data to the public and Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) collaborating scientists. I navigated the CDF's local, WCS, WFS, WMS distributions as well as their SQL and GeoServer-based databases to gather GIS data. I used QGIS and ArcGIS to analyze this data and then created associated, robust metadata. I helped to improve the GeoPortal’s user interface by building a lightweight, intuitive directory and Wiki using HTML/CSS. The current version of the web application can be viewed at geodata-fcdgps.opendata.arcgis.com/

* Galapagos National Park Internship
As a Galapagos National Park intern, I aided in the rearing and husbandry of 180 semi-captive, IUCN endangered *Chelonoidis chathamensis* tortoises. Tasks consisted of the collection of eggs, monitoring of incubation, care of neonates, preparations of cohort for repatriation, four separate monitoring campaigns, and organization of volunteers. Additionally, I re-invigorated San Cristobal Island’s endemic plant breeding program. Through avid seed and seedling collection, propagation, and nursery care I was able to produce several hundred plants from 20 endemic or native species that were distributed to park and community member land.

* Regulatory T-cell Research 
Through the University of Minnesota Medical School, I explored the potential of human regulatory T cell-based cellular therapy for Graft-Versus-Host Disease by independently designing and optimizing a novel lentiviral transduction program. The current lab group has continued to build upon my initial protocols. In my role, I also served as the manager of the experimental mouse breeding colony, supervised  four interns, and was a co-advisor to two undergraduate directed research projects. My work culminated in a publication in the journal Transplantation as co-author and a research symposium poster at the Masonic Cancer Center Research Symposium.

* Urban Forestry of Elm Trees
I aided in the research of Dutch elm disease, nursery techniques, and forestry in harsh, urban field sites. I was trained in plant propagation, agricultural, and pruning techniques in the care of cuttings, seedlings, young trees, as well as nursery stock. I collected seed and took geospatial correlated data at numerous field sites around the state in close collaboration with Saint Paul Parks and Recreation foresters. I personally managed 8 acres of field plots and completed a self-directed research project on *Arachis hypogaea* growing conditions.

* Human Physiology Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
As a teaching assistant (TA), I worked in a team with three professors and fellow TAs to deliver a high quality undergraduate human physiology curriculum. I met one-on-one with Dr. Lisa Anderson weekly to review lesson plans and educational goals. I corrected coursework, answered questions for students, and was in charge of leading lab practicals. Additionally, I self-implemented and guided lecture-style study sessions for students before large exams.
