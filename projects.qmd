* Exploring the Natural History of Galapagos Diptera
Self-directed research focusing on the invasive fly Philornis downsi and its control in the Galapagos. This work involves field research, data analysis using R, and collaboration with international scientists. Results contribute to understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species on endemic Galapagos wildlife.

* 3D Mapping of Bat Habitats in Abandoned Mines
Utilized LiDAR and GIS technologies to create comprehensive 3D models of abandoned mines, assessing their importance as bat habitats. This project demonstrates the application of advanced geospatial technologies in wildlife conservation efforts.

* Ecology and Biodiversity Course Development
Creation of a new USC course "BISC 499: Ecology and Biodiversity," including developing the syllabus, lab handouts, and assignments using R and Quarto. This contribution significantly enhances the educational resources for teaching quantitative ecology.

* Mojave Desert Tortoise Population Study
Conducted a systematic survey of the Mojave Desert Tortoise, combining line-distance sampling with health assessments. This project provides crucial data for the conservation and management of this vulnerable species across its range in the American Southwest.

* Galapagos National Park Volunteer Efforts
Engaged in multiple conservation tasks including tortoise husbandry, invasive plant eradication, and educational outreach. These efforts are part of a larger commitment to preserving the unique biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands through hands-on conservation and community engagement.
