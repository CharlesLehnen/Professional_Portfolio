## Background

I grew up loving nature. We joke that I am now paid to do the same thing I have done since I was a kid, dig around the backyard looking for creatures. I was fortunate to have the Mississippi River nearby to explore each day with friends. As I grew older, so did my adventures - from learning to camp in the Scouts to multi-week backcountry trips. I feel at home in the natural world.


## How did I get into ecology?

Like many other biology students, I was actually pre-med in college. After graduation, I went through the entire medical school application process while working in an immunology lab. When I went to click "submit" though, I felt nothing. No passion. So we took a leap. My partner and I had saved up enough to quit our jobs, sell off our belongings, and move to South America so I could fully commit to embracing a career in ecology. I haven't looked back since.


## Other things I enjoy

<ul style="list-style-type: none; ">
  <li><span><img src="images/icons/climbing.png" alt="" style="width: 1.25em; height: 1.25em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.5em;"></span> Rock climbing: I began climbing in the gym for fun, but it has grown into so much more. Many of my best friends are through climbing and I could not have excelled (or even have been considered for) some of my research roles without my climbing abilities.</li>
  <li><span><img src="images/icons/hiking.png" alt="" style="width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.5em;"></span> Hiking/backpacking: The Scouts is really what introduced me to backcountry backpacking. Similar to climbing but even moreso, I would not be the field ecologist that I am without my experience and passion for hiking.</li>
  <li><span><img src="images/icons/travelling.png" alt="" style="width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.5em;"></span> Travelling: My worldview expanded only once I left the US and truly experienced living my life in another country. I have been fortunate enough to be able to learn about other cultures through travel.</li>
  <li><span><img src="images/icons/spanish.png" alt="" style="width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.5em;"></span> Learning languages: I speak Spanish as a second language. Currently, I am learning Polish and French. I did not plan it this way, but am so grateful I learned to speak Spanish because it opened so many doors for my career in ecology and allows me to readily integrate with the communities where I conduct my research.</li>
