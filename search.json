    "text": "I am an ecologist driven to unravel the complexities of community dynamics and the cascading trophic effects that shape our natural world. My career has led me through a variety of roles, from leading a natural history study of Galapagos Diptera across five islands, assessing potential bat habitat in the man-made abandoned mineshafts of New Mexico, to conducting transects across the Nevada desert to track the population dynamics of Mojave Desert tortoises.\nAlong the way, I have honed my skills in the field working with cutting edge technologies including mutli-spectral drones, advanced GNSS systems, LiDAR, camera traps, and remote sensing. In the classroom, through TAships I have focused on teaching quantitive skills including Python, R, occupancy models, and bayesian statistics.\nCurrently, as a third-year PhD candidate at the University of Southern California, I am leading a team to research the effects of rewilding Santa Fe Island in the Galapagos through the introduction of Española Giant Tortoises (Chelonoidis hoodensis).\nInterests: Biogeography, Trophic Ecology, Ecological Restoration, Science Communication, Quantative Ecology\n\n\n\nI am always looking to collaborate and share ideas, feel free to reach out to me via email.\n\n\n\nScience education and work is an essential aspect of my work. If I am not helping to empower the next generation of scientists, I feel that my job as a scientist is not complete. If you are seeking mentorship, help, or just advice, please contact me via email."

    "text": "Employment Equity: An Analysis of Distribution of Salary Ranges of Public Service of Canada Employees\n{code}\nCode used to webscrape and visualize employee salary data from the Government of Canada’s Treasury Board. Here we demonstrate systemic disadvantage in career progression amongst Black public servants which must be resolved with a strategic plan to identify structural and systemic barriers and improve retention and success to levels achieved by their non-racialized peers.\nMaking a Research Website with Github and Hugo\nA tutorial for making a personal research website with Github and Hugo.\nPlanet aRt\n{code}\nMy attempt at making some pretty things with the generative art package, aRtsy.\nThesis Word Cloud\n{code}\nA quick little repo containing a script I used to create a word cloud from my thesis. Here I make a visually appealing representation of the frequency of words used to tell the story of what I’ve been working on for the past two and a half years.\nCoding Nature\nA repository for a workshop for Black high school students in Nova Scotia (ages 13+). This workshop aims to inspire passion for nature and science, while giving an introduction to coding logic and data. The included exercises demonstrate how we can use programming as a tool to improve our understanding of the world around us.\nIntro to Coding for Sr. High\nCode for a 2-day introductory coding tutorial for Bahamian high school students at Forest Heights Academy."
