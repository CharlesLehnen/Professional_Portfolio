    "text": "I am an ecologist driven to unravel the complexities of community dynamics and the cascading trophic effects that shape our natural world. My career has led me through a variety of roles, from leading a natural history study of Galapagos Diptera across five islands, assessing potential bat habitat in the man-made abandoned mineshafts of New Mexico, to conducting transects across the Nevada desert to track the population dynamics of Mojave Desert tortoises.\nAlong the way, I have honed my skills in the field working with cutting edge technologies including mutli-spectral drones, advanced GNSS systems, LiDAR, camera traps, and remote sensing. In the classroom, through TAships I have focused on teaching quantitive skills including Python, R, occupancy models, and bayesian statistics.\nCurrently, as a third-year PhD candidate at the University of Southern California, I am leading a team to research the effects of rewilding Santa Fe Island in the Galapagos through the introduction of Española Giant Tortoises (Chelonoidis hoodensis).\nInterests: Biogeography, Trophic Ecology, Ecological Restoration, Science Communication, Quantative Ecology\n\n\nI am always looking to collaborate and share ideas, feel free to reach out to me via email.\n\n\n\nScience education and work is an essential aspect of my work. If I am not helping to empower the next generation of scientists, I feel that my job as a scientist is not complete. If you are seeking mentorship, help, or just advice, please contact me via email."

    "text": "Exploring the Natural History of Galapagos Diptera Self-directed research focusing on the invasive fly Philornis downsi and its control in the Galapagos. This work involves field research, data analysis using R, and collaboration with international scientists. Results contribute to understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species on endemic Galapagos wildlife.\n3D Mapping of Bat Habitats in Abandoned Mines Utilized LiDAR and GIS technologies to create comprehensive 3D models of abandoned mines, assessing their importance as bat habitats. This project demonstrates the application of advanced geospatial technologies in wildlife conservation efforts.\nEcology and Biodiversity Course Development Creation of a new USC course “BISC 499: Ecology and Biodiversity,” including developing the syllabus, lab handouts, and assignments using R and Quarto. This contribution significantly enhances the educational resources for teaching quantitative ecology.\nMojave Desert Tortoise Population Study Conducted a systematic survey of the Mojave Desert Tortoise, combining line-distance sampling with health assessments. This project provides crucial data for the conservation and management of this vulnerable species across its range in the American Southwest.\nGalapagos National Park Volunteer Efforts Engaged in multiple conservation tasks including tortoise husbandry, invasive plant eradication, and educational outreach. These efforts are part of a larger commitment to preserving the unique biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands through hands-on conservation and community engagement."
